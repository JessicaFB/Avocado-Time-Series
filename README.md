# Avocado-Time-Series
Predicting demand and pricing for avocados utilizing Facebook's Prophet time series modeling package, fbprophet. 

This was a codealong tutorial from Coursera so I could learn/practice using Facebook Prophet. Although this was a codealong, I did tweak it to my liking. Differences can be seen between project notebook and solutions. I also added my own interpretations and commentary that were not spoken about in the tutorial. 

For any questions or discussion, please contact me at jlforrestbaldini@gmail.com. I look forward to connecting with you.
